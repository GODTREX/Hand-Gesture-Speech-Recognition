# Hand Gesture & Voice Command Control Application

This project is a **hand gesture and voice command control application** that uses computer vision and speech recognition to perform actions such as adjusting brightness, controlling slides, and managing system volume.

## Features

- **Hand Gesture Control**:  
  Use hand gestures to perform actions like:
  - Increase/Decrease screen brightness.
  - Navigate to the next or previous slide.
  - Continuous slide navigation.

- **Voice Command Control**:  
  Use voice commands to control:
  - Volume (increase or decrease).
  - Slide navigation (next, previous).
  - Exit the application.

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**:  
  - Simple Tkinter-based GUI for starting, stopping, or exiting the application.

   - Click the "Start" button to enable hand gesture and voice recognition.

2. **Hand Gestures**:
   - **1 Finger**: Increase brightness.
   - **2 Fingers**: Decrease brightness.
   - **3 Fingers**: Next slide.
   - **4 Fingers**: Previous slide.
   - **5 Fingers**: Continuous forward slide navigation.

3. **Voice Commands**:
   - **"Louder"**: Increase volume.
   - **"Lower"**: Decrease volume.
   - **"Next"**: Next slide.
   - **"Previous" or "Back"**: Previous slide.
